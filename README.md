+ The case fatality rate (CFR) is an important prognosis indicator of an emerging disease, defined as total deaths/total cases.
+ CFR is often reported in the media for cross-country comparisons.
+ However, CFR varies spatiotemporally and the variations are not easily explained.
+ Here I collect data to annalyze what may correalte with COVID-19 case fatality rates.
#### Use the jupyter notebook to learn more about COVID-19 CFR.
#### CFR and HAQ.xlsx contains the raw data.
#### CFR correlation input data includes data for correlation analysis or linear regression.
#### PLease remember to cite my work if you use the data.
